A blog on a home-education project on probability started when Julius was 12 at the beginning of the coronavirus epedimy and we were thinking a lot about statistics. The central limit theorem section was added when Jonathan prepared for AP Statistics.

We started by choosing a game that is played by rolling two dice such as backgammon or [the settlers of Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan). The aim is to have fun and to learn that not all values are equally likely. Moreover, knowing something about probabilities can help to build a strategy for the game.
