A blog on a home-education project on probability with Julius (12).

We started by choosing a game that is played by rolling two dice such as backgammon or [the settlers of Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan). The aim is to have fun and to learn that not all values are equally likely. Moreover, knowing something about probabilities can help to build a strategy for the game.

Then we threw the two dice 30 and made a list of the outcomes. Which outcomes are most frequent? Draw a bar chart with columns for the possible outcomes from 2 to 12 and the height of the column indicating how often an outcome happened.

Why appear some outcomes more often than others?

What would you expect from counting the possibilities?

Make another bar chart with columns for the possible outcomes from 2 to 12 and the height of the column indicating how many possibilities there are to achieve that outcome.

Should the two bar charts be the same? Or similar? Why are they so different?

What happens if we do the experiment again and do another 30 throws of two dice?

This is getting a bit boring to do by hand, so I wrote a little program called [two-dice.R](). You need to install R to run the program.
