A blog on a home-education project on probability with Julius (12).

We started by choosing a game that is played by rolling two dice such as backgammon or [the settlers of Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan). The aim is to have fun and to learn that not all values are equally likely. Moreover, knowing something about probabilities can help to build a strategy for the game.
